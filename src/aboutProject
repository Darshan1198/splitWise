         b) User logs expense with other user
         c) Helps with settlements

 Requirement Gathering
 1: Sketch

2; user Journey

clarify Requirements
1) is expenses paid by a single user as multiple users can pay
  A  B  C D  ( 10000)

  expense
  travel gift or xyz                           |26/12/2021
    Amount  = 10k                             |
    paid By = A(5k) + B(5k)                    |
    Shared b= A(1K) B(1K) C(4K) D(4K)          |

2) is the  expense  shared  equally? not necessary!

3) SHould an expense  in group always  involve all member? No
   roommates  4 members( A B C D)    A B C went dinner  yesterday why to add D

4) can an expense be added that doesn't belong to a group? NO

5) what is settling the  group ?
 RH -> A B CD
 Office  _> B C D

  A List of transaction  if followed would make everyones share  in the  group expense to 0
